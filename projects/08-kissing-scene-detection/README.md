# Intelligent Kissing Scene Detection System
> Chinese title: 接吻场景智能检测与识别系统
## Overview
- Detect kissing scenes from video content.
- Typical pipeline includes video decoding, feature extraction, and a classifier/segmentor.
- Inputs are videos; outputs are predicted segments and/or labels.
- Team: 关祺, 卢建君

## Project Structure
- `code/`: source code
- `data/`: dataset (not included; request by email)
- `weights/`: weights (not included; request by email)
- `slides/`: slides (not included; request by email)
- `tests/`: smoke tests

## Environment
- Activate environment:

```
conda activate pytorch
```
- Optional extra deps (if this project provides `requirements.txt`):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Getting Resources (Dataset / Weights / Slides)
- Email: blue16@email.swu.edu.cn
- Policy:
  - Academic research & educational exchange: free
  - Commercial use (e.g., patent applications, productization): requires explicit authorization
- Expected local paths:
  - `data/...`
  - `weights/...`

## Quick Start
Minimal validation (no datasets/weights required):

```
python tests/smoke_test.py
```
## Reproducibility Notes
- Prefer running the smoke test first; demo/inference commands (if any) are documented in `code/`.
- GPU memory depends on model/backbone; reduce batch size / image size when needed.

## Troubleshooting
- `Weights not found`: request resources by email and place files under `weights/`.
- `ModuleNotFoundError`: install optional dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if provided).
- CUDA issues: verify your PyTorch/CUDA installation matches your driver.
